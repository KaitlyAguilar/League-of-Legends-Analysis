# Introduction

Our dataset encompasses all professional League of Legends matches held in 2023. Each game is represented by 12 rows, with 10 rows dedicated per player and an additional two rows providing summary statistics for each participating team in the match. In this anlysis we will answering a couple of questions: Is a team more likely to win with a higher kills count or assists count? and  Is the mean number of kills by winning teams is the same as the mean number of kills by non-winning teams?

Individuals engaged in League of Legends gameplay may seek insights into strategies that enhance their chances of winning. Additionally, new players can utilize these findings to prioritize their learning objectives effectively.

The columns that we usefule in the analysis were:

* __Kills__ - Total kill count for the team
